# Traverse and Find `node_modules` Folders

This miniature utility recursively traverses a directory tree and prints
the paths of any directories that contain a `node_modules` folder.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (none required—this is a plain Node.js script).
2. Edit `script.js` and replace the `startDirectory` value with the path you
   want to inspect.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or directly:

   ```bash
   node ./script.js
   ```

## Notes & Limitations

- The script uses synchronous filesystem calls and will throw if it
  encounters directories you do not have permission to read.
- Symlinked directories are processed as regular directories, which can
  lead to infinite recursion if symlinks create cycles.
- The default `startDirectory` value in the repo is `D:\GIT`; update it to
  match your environment before running on other machines.
