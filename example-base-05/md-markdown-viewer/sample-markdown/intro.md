# Welcome to the Markdown Explorer

This tiny Node + Express application lets you browse Markdown files that live on your file system. Add more folders (or remove the sample content) in `configuration.js`.

## Why this exists

- Quickly preview docs without opening a new editor window.
- Render Markdown with **GitHub flavored** features.
- Highlight code blocks automatically with Prism.js.

```js
console.log('Hello from the Markdown explorer ✨');
```

> Tip: You can keep this sample file as a smoke test or replace it with your own documentation set.
